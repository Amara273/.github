## Contributing

Contributors to the G programming language are to detail the degree of changes that were invoked at each commit stage.
Maintaining a high level of professionalism in work and communication is paramount to the integrity of the G
programming languages and so the following guidelines must be followed:
<br></br>

1. __Adhere to the Tern Systems Coding Standards__
    * Follow established coding standards and style guides relevant to the Tern Systems project.
      
    * Ensure consistency in code formatting, naming conventions, and file organization.
<br></br>    
2. __Write Comprehensive Documentation__
    * Provide clear and concise documentation for all functions, classes, and modules.
      
    * Maintain an up-to-date README file that includes setup instructions, usage examples, and project overview.
<br></br>     
3. __Commit Often with Descriptive Messages__
    * Commit code changes frequently to avoid large, unwieldy commits.
      
    * Use descriptive commit messages that clearly explain the purpose of the changes.
<br></br>      
4. __Conduct Thorough Code Reviews__
    * Perform rigorous code reviews for all pull requests to ensure code quality and adherence to guidelines.
      
    * Provide constructive feedback and address all comments before merging code.
<br></br>      
5. __Ensure Robust Testing__
    * Write comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to cover all critical code paths.
      
    * Use continuous integration (CI) pipelines to run automated tests on every commit and pull request.
<br></br>      
6. __Prioritize Security and Performance__
    * Implement best practices for security, such as input validation, error handling, and secure authentication.
      
    * Optimize code for performance, ensuring efficient use of resources and minimal latency.
<br></br>      
7. __Maintain Clean and Modular Code__
    * Write clean, readable, and maintainable code by following the principles of modularity and separation of concerns.
      
    * Avoid code duplication and strive for reusability through well-defined interfaces and components.
<br></br>      
8. __Use Effective Branching Strategies__
    * Adopt a branching strategy such as GitFlow or feature branching to manage development workflows efficiently.
      
    * Ensure that the main branch remains stable and deployable by merging only thoroughly tested and reviewed code.

<br></br>
By following these guidelines, we ensure that our codebase remains high-quality, maintainable, and efficient, fostering a collaborative and productive development environment.
